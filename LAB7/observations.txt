Bar Chart:

France has the highest count among the three countries, with a value close to 5,000.
Spain and Germany have similar counts, both around 2,500 to 3,000, which are much lower than France's count.
This suggests that whatever metric is being measured is significantly more prevalent in France compared to Spain and Germany.
Pie Chart:

The majority of individuals fall under the "Stayed" category, with a count of 7,963, indicated by the green portion of the chart.
A smaller segment, "Exited", has a count of 2,037, shown in red.
This means that a larger proportion of the group stayed, while only a minority exited, indicating higher retention.
Histogram:

The histogram shows that the most frequent values fall within the 30-40 range, with the peak count being around 4,000.
There is a gradual decline in counts as the values increase beyond 40, with very few occurrences above 60.
This pattern suggests that the majority of data points are concentrated in the lower ranges, especially around 30-40, and taper off at higher values.


Common surnames such as "He," "Hu," "Boni," "Ricci," and "Lucas" appear prominently, suggesting their higher frequency.
The variety of font sizes indicates the relative frequency of each surname in the dataset.
Box and Whisker Plot of Balance:

The median balance appears to be within the first half of the data range.
There is a significant range in balances, with a few outliers on the high end, as indicated by the long whisker.
Regression Plot of Age vs. Estimated Salary:

The scatterplot shows no clear trend or correlation between age and estimated salary, as indicated by the nearly flat regression line.
There is considerable variance in salary at different ages, suggesting age alone may not be a strong predictor of salary in this dataset.
